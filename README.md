# Consumer-Producer

Please find two appliactions ilustarting Cosumer/Producer pattern: 
-  Console Application(ConsoleApp2) outputs data from one Producer and 2 Consumers (Console and File)
-  Xamarin.Forms Application(App1) has the same behaviour but is integrated with a UI (Another Consumers), futhermore File Type data objects are inserted into the SQLite DB

To start the Console application you will be required to press any key within the console. 
Please Run Xamarin Application on a simulator as Running on device would not work.
