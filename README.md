# Consumer-Producer

Please find two appliactions ilustarting Cosumer/Producer pattern: 
-  Console Application(ConsoleApp2) outputs data from one Producer and 2 Consumers using it (Console and File outputs)
-  Xamarin.Forms Application(App1) has the same behaviour but is integrated with a UI (Another Consumer), futhermore File Type data objects are inserted into the SQLite DB

To start the Console application you will be required to press any key within the console.Should run around 10s an then stop.
Please Run Xamarin.Forms Application on a iOS/Android simulator.
